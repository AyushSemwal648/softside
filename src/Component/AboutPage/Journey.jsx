            Long before The SoftSide emerged and before Hunt Innovations LLC
            made its mark, there was a vision. Derwin Hunt imagined a
            revolutionary product that could make every bathtub owner feel
            saferâ€”a creation that not only promised enhanced safety but also
            elevated the aesthetic of any bathroom. <br /> <br /> This vision
            was for everyone: for parents cautiously leaning over the tub as
            their children joyfully splash about; for grandparents in
            rehabilitation centers, supported by loved ones during their
            routines; and for travelers enjoying a moment of relaxation in hotel
            bathtubs. Derwin envisioned a product that would preserve the serene
            experience of a perfect bath, eliminating the fear of slipping with
            a simple reminder to "be careful." His dream was to safeguard this
            sanctuary-like experience, ensuring peace of mind during these
            precious moments.
